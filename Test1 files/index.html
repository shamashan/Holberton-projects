        <h2>Who I am?</h2>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Saria Shamashan</strong>. I am from Damascus,
          Syria. I arrived in France last year. I'm here with my family, my
          wife, my little boy and our cat.<br />
          I previously worked as a Windows application developer for about four
          years. Then, as a result of the security conditions in Syria, I left
          my country. Since then, my career was completely shifted to a
          different domain for the past six years.<br />I always followed news
          related to my old domain of work and related technology news. I
          decided to keep up what ever it takes. I learned myself some new
          technologies for developing web and mobile applications. I have now a
          good experience in this field!. See from this
          <a href="/skills.html">link</a> what technologies I learned.<br />
          <em
            >I always loved this field. It's great, it's the future of
            humanity!</em

        <h3>What I am looking for?</h3>
        <p>
          Let's be honest with ourselves. We can never give up. We always have
          to keep going. Otherwise we will be left behind! <br />In the world of
          technology, we have to remain vigilant. We follow everything new,
          develop ourselves continuously, and learn new technologies.<br />We
          have to learn and work to offer a lot to our world. There are so many
          people waiting for people like us. Who work hard to make their own
          lives and the lives of these people easier.<br />Our mission is to
          make our lives and the lives of others better. <br />In order to
          achieve our goals, we must choose the right path and work with those
          who have experience. <br />We have to choose them carefully. I delayed

        <h3>Why Holberton?</h3>
        <p>
          Holberton School is named after Betty Holberton, one of the most
          famous women software engineers and the original programmer of the
          first digital electronic computer. Holberton offers training to
          students to become highly skilled software and operations engineers
          through project-based and peer learning.<br />Holberton was founded by
          Julien Barbier and Sylvain Kalache, who previously co-founded while42,
          the largest French tech engineer network, and worked at Docker and
          SlideShare/LinkedIn respectively. They are saying good thing about
